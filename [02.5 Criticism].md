This story suffers from a fatal case of "telling" instead of "showing".  The prose is clunky and laden with exposition, robbing the reader of any genuine engagement with the world and characters.  It's like reading a summary of a story, rather than experiencing it firsthand.

**Here's a breakdown of the major issues:**

* **Excessive Exposition:**  The story is drowning in descriptions and explanations. We're constantly told how Alex feels, how Oakhaven reacts, and what the echo represents.  Instead of showing us through actions, dialogue, and sensory details, we're bombarded with expositional paragraphs.

* **Uninspired Dialogue:**  The dialogue is flat and lifeless. There's no spark, no sense of character or personality.  It reads like a script for a high school play, devoid of nuance or wit. 

* **Lack of Internal Conflict:** While the external conflict (the echo) is established, Alex's internal struggle feels underdeveloped. We know he's haunted by a past trauma, but we never see him grappling with it. Instead, it's just stated as a fact.

* **Overreliance on Clichés:** The plot relies heavily on predictable tropes: the mysterious town, the ancient evil, the chosen one, etc.  There's a lack of originality and freshness in the story's overall premise.

**Here are some concrete suggestions for improvement:**

* **Show, Don't Tell:**  Instead of describing Alex's feelings, show us through his actions, his body language, his reactions to events. Let the reader infer his emotions. 

* **Craft Compelling Dialogue:**  Give your characters distinct voices.  Use dialogue to reveal their personalities, their motivations, and their relationships with each other.

* **Explore Internal Conflict:**  Dive deeper into Alex's past trauma. Show us his nightmares, his anxieties, his struggle to come to terms with the past. 

* **Subvert Expectations:**  Don't rely on cliché.  Think about ways to twist the familiar tropes, to introduce unexpected twists and turns to the plot. 

**Specific Examples:**

* Instead of "He felt a chill crawl up his spine," show us Alex's shivering body, his rapid breaths, his eyes darting around nervously.

* Instead of "The echo grew bolder," show us how the whispering voices begin to form words, how they interrupt his thoughts, how they taunt him with fragments of his memories.

* Instead of "The vigilantes were chanting," describe the sounds of their voices, the rhythmic pounding of their fists on the ancient oak, the frenzy in their eyes.

The potential for a captivating story about the power of the past and the weight of hidden truths exists within this manuscript.  But the author needs to commit to showing, not telling, to creating a world that feels real and tangible, and to crafting characters that resonate with the reader.  Only then can the story truly come alive.
